The real frustrating thing is that this Defense is good enough to win a Super Bowl. Way better than anything we have ever had. #PackPanic
Why is @coldplay playing the @NFL halftime show?! It's the fucking 50th anniversary of the #Super Bowl. That's all you got @NFL? That's it?
Another year, another Super Bowl Halftime return denied for Up With People. #upwithpeople #SuperBowlHalftime
This is all @TheMattBungard. He passed the #BungardCurse on from the Ravens to us when he doubled down on us making the Super Bowl.
They should get @kendricklamar to perform at the Super Bowl... But that would be too LIT... #superbowl50halftime
I guess we can all sit around and be content with 2010 and last year's almost Super Bowl. #packers #rantended
Should've gotten someone better... It's not just any super bowl it's Super Bowl 50! #SBL  https://t.co/h3N8FDgoSB

A British band who calls another sport football are chosen as the superlative rep to perform at the American 50th Super Bowl?  #confused
Half time at the Super Bowl would be an awesome 'one last final gig' for Motley Crue. #JustSaying  https://t.co/1wabJgmfUG
