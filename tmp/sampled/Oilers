I often catch myself wondering if #TylerSeguin would be the same caliber of player he is now if he was drafted by the @Oilers.
@EdmontonOilers #DALvsEDM  Oilers rock it..Let's go..
Dallas is lying in in the neutral zone weeds waiting for mistakes. Even the skilled teams (semi) trap on the #Oilers.
I think we need to get @ebs_14 a bucket of chicken. #Oilers #snakebitten
